    "Download the encrypted file https://siscourses.ethz.ch/python_dbiol/data/encoded.txt. The text was encoded by a \"simple substituion cipher\" as described at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitution_cipher#Simple_substitution. The cipher kept space characters as space characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "To break the cipher we make use of the fact that letters occur with different frequencies in texts. This distribution depends on the actual language.\n",
    "\n",
    "We assume that the letters in english texts ordered by their frequency are `etaonhisrldwugfycbmkpvjqxz`. So `e` is the most common character, `t` the second common character and so on. (This ordering is not fixed but depends on the text corpus used, so you will find slightly modified version on the internet).\n",
    "\n",
    "So if a simple substituion cipher maps `e` to `a` we should see that `a` occurs most often in the encrypted text (given that the original text was in english and that the encrypted text is long enough).\n",
    "\n",
    "To decode the text:\n",
    "\n",
    " - first order the letters from the encoded text by their frequency\n",
    " - then construct a dictionary to map the characters from the given text to their most probable counterpart \n",
    " - and finally use this to decode the text. \n",
    "\n",
